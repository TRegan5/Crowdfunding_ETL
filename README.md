# Crowdfunding_ETL

The majority of work was able to be completed based on instrucitonal slides, notes, and in class activities. 

Some assistance came from online searches:

-How extract a dictionary stored within a string? --> use json.loads() - https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_json.asp

-Merging multiple dataframes - https://sparkbyexamples.com/pandas/pandas-merge-multiple-dataframes

Special thanks to our TA Rhythm Ahir for helping troubleshoot a new PGadmin install and subsequent uploads of csv files to our SQL database in pgAdmin!!!

All csv files were exported and stroed in the Resources folder under this project.

The database ERD (created at https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/d/D8IgWK) and exported schema (crowdfunding_db_schema.sql) are stored separately in the Database folder. 

Finally, all query files to check data in each of the four database tables are also stored in teh Database folder.
